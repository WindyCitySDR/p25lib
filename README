Welcome to OP25

OP25 is a project that brings together folks that are interested in
software for processing APCO P25 traffic which is available under the
GNU Public License (GPL). We have implemented software-defined radios
for transmit and receive, a library for processing P25 traffic and
patches to add P25 support to  the WireShark network traffic analzyzer.

The project's wiki, bug tracking, and source code viewer can be found
at http://www.sedition.org.au. If you've got questions about
installing or using OP25 please subscribe to the op25-dev mailing list
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/op25-dev) and post your questions
there. Please see the file COPYING for the license.
